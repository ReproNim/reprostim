[Install]

 python3.10 -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate
 pip install --upgrade pip
 pip install -r audio-codes-requirements.txt

 On MacOS:
  brew install portaudio
  pip install pyaudio

 On Linux:
  sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev


[TODO]

 Review `psychopy` and sound API and possibly use PTB's
 facilities in PsychoPy for precise audio placement in time:
   https://www.psychopy.org/download.html
   https://psychopy.org/api/sound/playback.html

 Look at watermark in audio.

[psychopy, sound, ptb]

Note: PsychoPy (2024.2.3) current requirements limits/suggests
      to Python version 3.10.

 On MacOS:
    Download and install the standalone package:
    PsychoPy 2024.2.3 modern (py3.10)
    https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases/download/2024.2.3/StandalonePsychoPy-2024.2.3-macOS-py3.10.dmg

  Run PsychoPy and check the sound settings that `pbt` is
  set as `Audio Library`.

  Make sure Python 3.10 is installed and venv is explicitly created with it:
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r audio-codes-requirements.txt

 Note: first time psychoPy is run, it may take a long time to setup audio
       download additional dependencies.


[Summary]
    - `PyDub` allows you to generate simple tones easily.
    -  FSK modulation can be achieved using `numpy` and
    `scipy` to create varying frequency tones based on
    binary input.
    - Optionally `DTMF` encoding is implemented using
    predefined frequency pairs, and you can detect
    DTMF tones by analyzing the audio input.

    - Chirp SDK:
      Chirp.io / https://www.sonos.com/en/home
      https://github.com/chirp

    - GNU Radio - can be used to encode/modulate/demodulate.
      https://www.gnuradio.org/
      Supports Frequency Shift Keying (FSK),
      Phase Shift Keying (PSK), or Amplitude Modulation (AM).

    - `reedsolo` can be used for ECC (Error Correction Codes).
