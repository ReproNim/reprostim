Notes for analysis on the video sizes recorded by reprostim-videocapture utility with command like below:

(venv) @typhon:~/reprostim/Parsing$ ./parse_wQR.py --mode=INFO /data/repronim/reprostim-reproiner/Videos/2024/07

Before changes recorded mkv video file size was around        :  2-7   MB /minute.
After changes with bitrate 2Mb the video file size was around :  15-19 MB /minute.

So most likely the video size is increased in 4 times+ after applied changes in the second half of Sep 2024.

Since Oct 2, 2024 we increased the ffmpeg bitrate limits to 8Mb from 2Mb, but at this moment don't have statistics yet
on the video sizes.
