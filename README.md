ReproStim is a video capture and recording suite for neuroimaging and
psychology experiments.  Its goal is to provide experimenters with a
complete record of audio and visual stimulation for every data collection
session by making it possible to easily collect high fidelity copies of the
actual stimuli shown to each subject in the form of video files that can be
stored alongside  behavioral or neuroimaging data in public repositories.
ReproStim is part of large ReproFlow process represented in the diagram below:

ReproStim provides for enhanced experimental reproducibility and a safeguard
against data loss in cases of data-collection irregularities.  Because
ReproStim provides an exact record of the actual stimuli delivered during
any given experimental session, it makes it possible to precisely reproduce
experimental sessions, even if the original trial sets were randomized and
precise trial details not recorded. In cases of experimental irregularities,
such as aborted fMRI runs, unexpected glitches in trial timing, or
programming errors that cause records of trial conditions to be lost,
valuable data (which can be especially costly in cases of fMRI of ECog, for
example) can be recoded and recovered using the audiovisual record provided
by ReproStim.

ReproStim requires minimal effort on behalf of investigators.  Once it is
setup as the default mode within a behavioral lab or neuroimaging center,
investigators can reap the benefits of ReproStim without any additional
effort on the part of individual experimenters.  When successfully set up,
ReproStim runs in the background, silently collecting, cataloging, and
storing all audio and visual stimulation delivered to experimental subjects.
